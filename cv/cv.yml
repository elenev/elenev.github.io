        How much capital should financial intermediaries hold? We propose a general equilibrium model
        with a financial sector that makes risky long-term loans to firms, funded by deposits from savers. 
        Government guarantees create a role for bank capital regulation. The model captures the sharp 
        and persistent drop in macro-economic aggregates and credit provision as well as the sharp 
        change in credit spreads observed during financial crises. Policies requiring intermediaries 
        to hold more capital reduce financial fragility, reduce the size of the financial and 
        non-financial sectors, and lower intermediary profits. They redistribute wealth from savers 
        to the owners of banks and non-financial firms. Pre-crisis capital requirements are close 
        to optimal. Counter-cyclical capital requirements increase welfare.

        We provide strong evidence of a countercyclical sensitivity of the stock market to major macroeconomic 
        announcements. The most notable cyclical variation takes place within expansions: sensitivity is 
        largest early in an expansion and essentially zero late in an expansion. By exploiting the 
        comovement pattern between stocks and bonds around announcements, we show that the stock market 
        sensitivity is large when the cash flow component of news is least offset by news about future 
        risk-free rates. Observed fluctuations in stock sensitivities can be attributed to shifting 
        perceptions of monetary policy responsiveness.

      abstract: >
        We develop a new model of the mortgage market that emphasizes the role of the financial sector and 
        the government. Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient 
        borrowers. Both borrowers and intermediaries can default. The government provides both mortgage 
        guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier 
        mortgage originations and higher financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into 
        financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries’ balance sheets. 
        Foreclosure crises beget fiscal uncertainty, further disrupting the optimal allocation of risk in 
        the economy. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee “crowds in” the private sector, reduces 
        financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage 
        and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector and less fiscal uncertainty, 
        consumption smoothing improves and foreclosure rates fall. While borrowers are nearly indifferent 
        to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate 
        welfare increases, so does wealth inequality.

      abstract: >
        The covid-19 crisis has led to a sharp deterioration in firm and bank balance sheets. The government 
        has responded with a massive intervention in corporate credit markets. We study equilibrium dynamics 
        of macroeconomic quantities and prices, and how they are affected by this policy response. The 
        interventions prevent a much deeper crisis by reducing corporate bankruptcies by about half and 
        short-circuiting the doom loop between corporate and financial sector fragility. The additional 
        fiscal cost is zero since programme spending replaces what would otherwise have been spent on financial 
        sector bailouts. An alternative intervention that targets aid to firms at risk of bankruptcy prevents 
        more bankruptcies at much lower fiscal cost, but only enjoys marginally higher welfare. Finally, we 
        study longer-run consequences for firm leverage and intermediary health when pandemics become the 
        new normal.

      abstract: >
        This paper investigates the direct and spillover effects on mobility caused by the staggered adoption 
        of Stay-at-Home orders (SHOs) implemented by U.S. counties to contain the spread of COVID-19. We 
        find that mobility in neighboring counties declines by a third to a half as much as in the counties 
        that first implement the SHOs. Further, these spillovers are concentrated in counties that share 
        media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we find that declines in 
        internal mobility in the neighbor counties account for a much larger proportion of the overall decline 
        in mobility than decreases in traffic originating in the treated county and headed to the neighbor. 
        Together, these results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and 
        voluntary social distancing. Based on our estimates and a simple model of staggered SHO adoption, we 
        construct counterfactual scenarios that separate the impact of policy coordination from that of adoption 
        timing. We demonstrate that staggered implementation of SHO policies can yield mobility reductions that 
        are larger than coordinated but delayed SHO policy adoption.

    - title: Interest Rate Risk and Cross-Sectional Effects of Micro-Prudential Regulation
      coauthors: Juliane Begenau, Vadim Elenev, and Tim Landvoigt
      abstract: >
        This paper investigates the financial stability consequences of banks' interest rate risk 
        exposure and uninsured deposit funding share. We develop a model incorporating insured and 
        uninsured deposits, interest rate-sensitive securities, and credit-risky loans to understand 
        how banks respond to interest rate risk and the potential for deposit runs. The model 
        delivers the concentration of uninsured deposits in larger banks and examines how banks' 
        portfolio- and funding choices impact financial stability.  We study the effects of recent 
        Federal Reserve rate hikes on banks and analyze micro-prudential policy tools to enhance 
        the banking sector's resilience. Higher liquidity requirements that target uninsured 
        deposits are effective at curbing run risk of large banks, but cause misallocation in the 
        lending market. Size-dependent capital requirements are equally effective at mitigating 
        run risk, with minimal unintended consequences.

    - title: "The Comovement of Voter Preferences: Insights from U.S. Presidential Election Prediction Markets Beyond Polls"
      coauthors: Vadim Elenev, Dongho Song
      abstract: > 
        We propose a novel time-series econometric framework to forecast U.S. Presidential election outcomes 
        in real time by combining polling data, economic fundamentals, and political prediction market prices. 
        Our model estimates the joint dynamics of voter preferences across states. Applying our approach to the 2024 
        Presidential Election, we find a two-factor structure driving the vast majority of the variation in voter 
        preferences. We identify electorally similar state clusters without relying on historical data or demographic 
        models of voter behavior. Our simulations quantify the correlations between state-level election outcomes. 
        Failing to take the correlations into account can bias the forecasted win probability for a given candidate by 
        several percentage points. We find Pennsylvania to be the most pivotal state in the 2024 election, followed 
        by Nevada. Our results provide insights for election observers, candidates, and traders.

    - title: "A Macro-Finance Model of Mortgage Structure: Financial Stability & Risk Sharing"
      coauthors: Vadim Elenev, Lu Liu
      abstract: >
        Mortgage structure matters not only for monetary policy transmission, but also  
        for financial stability. In an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) regime, interest  
        rate rises cause higher default rates due to increases in mortgage payments. In  
        a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) regime, households are protected, but banks are  
        potentially more exposed to rate rises. To evaluate these competing mechanisms  
        under different mortgage regimes, we build a quantitative model with flexible  
        mortgage contract structures, borrowers, and an intermediary sector. Our  
        approach allows us to capture borrowers' endogenous default decisions and  
        equilibrium pricing effects on mortgage rates and risk premia, reflecting  
        interaction effects between interest rate and credit risk, and intermediary net  
        worth. We find that financial stability risks are "U-shaped" in mortgage  
        structure: while ARM payments are more sensitive to interest rates, defaults  
        happen in states when intermediary net worth is high, resulting in lower risk  
        premia compared to the benchmark FRM economy. As a result, an intermediate  
        mortgage fixation length minimizes the volatility of intermediary net worth. We  
        contrast financial stability effects with the effects on risk-sharing, with  
        implications for mortgage design, macroprudential, and monetary policy.

      abstract: >
        We study sources and implications of undiversified portfolios in a production-based asset pricing model 
        with financial frictions. Households take concentrated positions in a single firm exposed to idiosyncratic 
        shocks because managerial effort requires equity stakes, and because investors gain private benefits from 
        concentrated holdings. Matching data on returns and portfolios, we find that the marginal investor 
        optimally holds 45% of their portfolio in a single firm, incentivizing managerial effort that accounts 
        for 4% of aggregate output. Investors derive control benefits equivalent to 3% points of excess return, 
        rationalizing low observed returns on undiversified holdings in the data. A counterfactual world of 
        full diversification would feature higher risk free rates, lower risk premiums on fully diversified and 
        concentrated assets, less capital accumulation, yet higher consumption and welfare. Exposure to 
        undiversified firm risk can explain approximately 40% of the level and 20% of the volatility of the 
        equity premium. A targeted subsidy that decreases diversification improves welfare by increasing 
        managerial effort and reducing financial frictions.

      abstract: >
        Governments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the GFC and Covid crises, 
        increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid? What role do 
        conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian 
        model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, 
        and substantial risk premia. During a large economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax 
        revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. Quantitative 
        easing (QE) contributes to lowering the debt/GDP ratio and reducing the risk of future tax increases. QE 
        is state- and duration-dependent: while a temporary QE policy deployed in a crisis stimulates aggregate 
        demand, permanent QE crowds out investment and lowers long-run output.

      abstract: >
        I develop a quantitative model of the mortgage market operating in an economy with financial frictions and 
        nominal rigidities. I use this model to study the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by 
        a central bank as a tool of monetary policy. When negative shocks hit, homeowner and financial sector 
        balance sheets are impaired, borrowing constraints bind, asset prices and aggregate demand drop, hampering 
        the transmission of conventional monetary policy. LSAPs boost aggregate demand in a crisis by directing 
        additional lending to homeowners, raising house prices, and establishing expectations of future financial 
        stability. However, legacy household debt depresses output and consumption in recovery. In the long run, 
        a commitment to ongoing use of LSAPs in crises reduces credit and business cycle volatility and 
        redistributes resources from borrowers and intermediaries to savers.
