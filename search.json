We propose a general equilibrium model with a financial sector that makes risky long-term loans to firms, funded by deposits from savers. Government guarantees create a role for bank capital regulation. The model captures the sharp and persistent drop in macro-economic aggregates and credit provision as well as the sharp change in credit spreads observed during financial crises. Policies requiring intermediaries to hold more capital reduce financial fragility, reduce the size of the financial and non-financial sectors, and lower intermediary profits. They redistribute wealth from savers to the owners of banks and non-financial firms. Pre-crisis capital requirements are close to optimal. Counter-cyclical capital requirements increase welfare.\nPresentations:\n\nMichigan Ross, Ann Arbor, MI, Nov 2019\nMcGill Desautels, Montreal, Quebec, Aug 2019\nComputing in Economics and Finance, New York, NY, Jun 2017\nMacro Finance Society IX Workshop, Chicago, IL, May 2017\nEconometric Society North American Summer Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, Jun 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFearing the Fed: How Wall Street Reads Main Street?Vadim Elenev, Tzuo-Hann Law, Dongho Song, and Amir YaronJournal of Financial Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal] [Code]\nWe provide strong evidence of a countercyclical sensitivity of the stock market to major macroeconomic announcements. The most notable cyclical variation takes place within expansions: sensitivity is largest early in an expansion and essentially zero late in an expansion. By exploiting the comovement pattern between stocks and bonds around announcements, we show that the stock market sensitivity is large when the cash flow component of news is least offset by news about future risk-free rates. Observed fluctuations in stock sensitivities can be attributed to shifting perceptions of monetary policy responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhasing out the GSEsVadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, and Stijn Van NieuwerburghJournal of Monetary Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal]\nWe develop a new model of the mortgage market that emphasizes the role of the financial sector and the government. Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. Both borrowers and intermediaries can default. The government provides both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations and higher financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries’ balance sheets. Foreclosure crises beget fiscal uncertainty, further disrupting the optimal allocation of risk in the economy. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee “crowds in” the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector and less fiscal uncertainty, consumption smoothing improves and foreclosure rates fall. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases, so does wealth inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan the Covid Bailouts Save the Economy?Vadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, and Stijn Van NieuwerburghEconomic Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal] [Code]\nThe covid-19 crisis has led to a sharp deterioration in firm and bank balance sheets. The government has responded with a massive intervention in corporate credit markets. We study equilibrium dynamics of macroeconomic quantities and prices, and how they are affected by this policy response. The interventions prevent a much deeper crisis by reducing corporate bankruptcies by about half and short-circuiting the doom loop between corporate and financial sector fragility. The additional fiscal cost is zero since programme spending replaces what would otherwise have been spent on financial sector bailouts. An alternative intervention that targets aid to firms at risk of bankruptcy prevents more bankruptcies at much lower fiscal cost, but only enjoys marginally higher welfare. Finally, we study longer-run consequences for firm leverage and intermediary health when pandemics become the new normal.\nPresentations:\n\nBank of Portugal, Virtual, Nov 2020\nIMF Annual Research Conference, Virtual, Nov 2020\nMelbourne, Virtual, Aug 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaggered Health Policy Adoption: Spillover Effects and Their ImplicationsVadim Elenev, Luis Quintero, Alessandro Rebucci, and Emilia SimeonovaManagement Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal]\nThis paper investigates the direct and spillover effects on mobility caused by the staggered adoption of Stay-at-Home orders (SHOs) implemented by U.S. counties to contain the spread of COVID-19. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declines by a third to a half as much as in the counties that first implement the SHOs. Further, these spillovers are concentrated in counties that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we find that declines in internal mobility in the neighbor counties account for a much larger proportion of the overall decline in mobility than decreases in traffic originating in the treated county and headed to the neighbor. Together, these results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and voluntary social distancing. Based on our estimates and a simple model of staggered SHO adoption, we construct counterfactual scenarios that separate the impact of policy coordination from that of adoption timing. We demonstrate that staggered implementation of SHO policies can yield mobility reductions that are larger than coordinated but delayed SHO policy adoption."

We develop a model incorporating insured and uninsured deposits, interest rate-sensitive securities, and credit-risky loans to understand how banks respond to interest rate risk and the potential for deposit runs. The model delivers the concentration of uninsured deposits in larger banks and examines how banks’ portfolio- and funding choices impact financial stability. We study the effects of recent Federal Reserve rate hikes on banks and analyze micro-prudential policy tools to enhance the banking sector’s resilience. Higher liquidity requirements that target uninsured deposits are effective at curbing run risk of large banks, but cause misallocation in the lending market. Size-dependent capital requirements are equally effective at mitigating run risk, with minimal unintended consequences.\nPresentations:\n\nWestern Finance Association, Snowbird, UT, Jun 2025\nSFS Cavalcade, Hoboken, NJ, May 2025\nNBER Financial Market Frictions and Systemic Risks, Boston, MA, Mar 2025\nMidwest Finance Association, Chicago, IL, Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Comovement of Voter Preferences: Insights from U.S. Presidential Election Prediction Markets Beyond PollsMikhail Chernov, Vadim Elenev, Dongho Song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NBER] [SSRN (Realtime Forecast)]\nWe propose a novel time-series econometric framework to forecast U.S. Presidential election outcomes in real time by combining polling data, economic fundamentals, and political prediction market prices. Our model estimates the joint dynamics of voter preferences across states. Applying our approach to the 2024 Presidential Election, we find a two-factor structure driving the vast majority of the variation in voter preferences. We identify electorally similar state clusters without relying on historical data or demographic models of voter behavior. Our simulations quantify the correlations between state-level election outcomes. Failing to take the correlations into account can bias the forecasted win probability for a given candidate by several percentage points. We find Pennsylvania to be the most pivotal state in the 2024 election, followed by Nevada. Our results provide insights for election observers, candidates, and traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Structure, Financial Stability, and Risk SharingVadim Elenev, Lu Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nMortgage structure matters not only for monetary policy transmission, but also for financial stability. In an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) regime, interest rate rises cause higher default rates due to increases in mortgage payments. In a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) regime, households are protected, but banks are potentially more exposed to rate rises. To evaluate these competing mechanisms under different mortgage regimes, we build a quantitative model with flexible mortgage contract structures, borrowers, and an intermediary sector. Our approach captures borrowers’ endogenous default decisions and intermediaries’ equilibrium pricing effects on mortgage rates and risk premia, reflecting the interaction between interest rate and credit risks, and intermediary net worth. We find that financial stability risks are “U-shaped” in mortgage structure: while ARM payments are more sensitive to interest rates, defaults happen in states when intermediary net worth is high, resulting in lower risk premia in constrained states of the world compared to the benchmark FRM economy. As a result, an intermediate mortgage fixation length minimizes the volatility of intermediary net worth and improves the sharing of aggregate risks. Our findings have implications for mortgage design, macroprudential, and monetary policy.\nPresentations:\n\nWestern Finance Association, Snowbird, UT, Jun 2025\nSFS Cavalcade, Hoboken, NJ, May 2025\nColumbia Workshop in New Empirical Finance, New York, NY, May 2025\nChicago Fed, Chicago, IL, Apr 2025\nWharton, Philadelphia, PA, Mar 2025\nCUNY Baruch, New York, NY, Dec 2024\nAmerican Real Estate and Urban Economics Association National Conference, Washington, DC, May 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset Pricing with Optimal Under-DiversificationVadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nWe study sources and implications of undiversified portfolios in a production-based asset pricing model with financial frictions. Households take concentrated positions in a single firm exposed to idiosyncratic shocks because managerial effort requires equity stakes, and because investors gain private benefits from concentrated holdings. Matching data on returns and portfolios, we find that the marginal investor optimally holds 45% of their portfolio in a single firm, incentivizing managerial effort that accounts for 4% of aggregate output. Investors derive control benefits equivalent to 3% points of excess return, rationalizing low observed returns on undiversified holdings in the data. A counterfactual world of full diversification would feature higher risk free rates, lower risk premiums on fully diversified and concentrated assets, less capital accumulation, yet higher consumption and welfare. Exposure to undiversified firm risk can explain approximately 40% of the level and 20% of the volatility of the equity premium. A targeted subsidy that decreases diversification improves welfare by increasing managerial effort and reducing financial frictions.\nPresentations:\n\nMidwest Finance Association, Chicago, IL, Mar 2024\nAmerican Finance Association, San Antonio, TX, Jan 2024\nEuropean Finance Association, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Aug 2023\nWestern Finance Association, San Francisco, CA, Jun 2023\nHong Kong University, Virtual, Apr 2023\nITAM, Mexico City, Mexico, Oct 2023\nUVa Darden, Charlottesville, VA, Sep 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Monetary Policy Create Fiscal Capacity?Vadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, Patrick Shultz, and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nGovernments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the GFC and Covid crises, increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid? What role do conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, and substantial risk premia. During a large economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. Quantitative easing (QE) contributes to lowering the debt/GDP ratio and reducing the risk of future tax increases. QE is state- and duration-dependent: while a temporary QE policy deployed in a crisis stimulates aggregate demand, permanent QE crowds out investment and lowers long-run output.\nPresentations:\n\nAmerican Economic Association, New Orleans, LA, Jan 2023\nNebraska, Lincoln, NE, Sep 2022\nFinancial Intermediary Research Society, Budapest, Hungary, Jun 2022\nUSC Marshall, Los Angeles, CA, Apr 2022\nTepper LAEF Advances in Macro Finance, Santa Barbara, CA, Apr 2022\nUNC Jackson Hole Winter Finance, Teton Village, WY, Jan 2022\nCarnegie Mellon Tepper, Virtual, Oct 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Credit, Aggregate Demand, and Unconventional Monetary PolicyVadim Elenev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nI develop a quantitative model of the mortgage market operating in an economy with financial frictions and nominal rigidities. I use this model to study the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by a central bank as a tool of monetary policy. When negative shocks hit, homeowner and financial sector balance sheets are impaired, borrowing constraints bind, asset prices and aggregate demand drop, hampering the transmission of conventional monetary policy. LSAPs boost aggregate demand in a crisis by directing additional lending to homeowners, raising house prices, and establishing expectations of future financial stability. However, legacy household debt depresses output and consumption in recovery. In the long run, a commitment to ongoing use of LSAPs in crises reduces credit and business cycle volatility and redistributes resources from borrowers and intermediaries to savers.\nPresentations:\n\nJHU Applied Math, Baltimore, MD, Mar 2019\nJHU Econ, Baltimore, MD, Apr 2018\nCUNY Baruch, New York, NY, Nov 2017\nPenn State Smeal, State College, PA, Oct 2017\nSyracuse Whitman, Syracuse, NY, Feb 2017\nWharton, Philadelphia, PA, Feb 2017\nUCSD Rady, La Jolla, CA, Feb 2017\nWashington University Olin, Clayton, MO, Feb 2017\nImperial College, London, U.K., Feb 2017\nLondon Business School, London, U.K., Feb 2017\nJohns Hopkins Carey, Baltimore, MD, Jan 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative TighteningVadim Elenev, Miguel Faria e Castro, and Daniel Greenwald\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentations:\n\nDC-Area Juniors, Washington, DC, May 2019\nAmerican Real Estate and Urban Economics Association, Washington DC, May 2019\nUMBC, Catonsville, MD, Apr 2019\nUNC Junior Finance Roundtable, Chapel Hill, NC, Mar 2019"

We propose a general equilibrium model with a financial sector that makes risky long-term loans to firms, funded by deposits from savers. Government guarantees create a role for bank capital regulation. The model captures the sharp and persistent drop in macro-economic aggregates and credit provision as well as the sharp change in credit spreads observed during financial crises. Policies requiring intermediaries to hold more capital reduce financial fragility, reduce the size of the financial and non-financial sectors, and lower intermediary profits. They redistribute wealth from savers to the owners of banks and non-financial firms. Pre-crisis capital requirements are close to optimal. Counter-cyclical capital requirements increase welfare.\nPresentations:\n\nMichigan Ross, Ann Arbor, MI, Nov 2019\nMcGill Desautels, Montreal, Quebec, Aug 2019\nFinancial Intermediation Research Society, Savannah, GA, May 2019 (by coauthor)\nECB Research Workshop, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Dec 2018 (by coauthor)\nNBER Summer Institute, Cambridge, MA, Jul 2018 (by coauthor)\nGerman Economists Abroad, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Dec 2017 (by coauthor)\nBank of Canada Financial Stability Monetary Policy, Ottawa, Canada, Nov 2017 (by coauthor)\nJoint Central Bankers, Cleveland, OH, Nov 2017 (by coauthor)\nComputing in Economics and Finance, New York, NY, Jun 2017\nMacro Finance Society IX Workshop, Chicago, IL, May 2017\nInternational Conference on Financial Markets and Macroeconomic Performance, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, May 2017 (by coauthor)\nFRBSF Conference on Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy, San Francisco, CA, Mar 2017 (by coauthor)\nUNC Jackson Hole Winter Finance, Teton Village, WY, Jan 2017 (by coauthor)\nAmerican Finance Association, Chicago, IL, Jan 2017 (by coauthor)\nTepper LAEF Advances in Macro Finance, Pittsburgh, PA, Sep 2016 (by coauthor)\nRiksbank Conference on Interconnected Financial Systems, Stockholm, Sweden, Sep 2016 (by coauthor)\nESSFM Gerzensee, Switzerland, Jul 2016 (by coauthor)\nEconometric Society North American Summer Meeting, Philadelphia, PA, Jun 2016\nSociety for Economic Dynamics, Toulouse, France, Jun 2016 (by coauthor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFearing the Fed: How Wall Street Reads Main Street?Vadim Elenev, Tzuo-Hann Law, Dongho Song, and Amir YaronJournal of Financial Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal] [Code]\nWe provide strong evidence of a countercyclical sensitivity of the stock market to major macroeconomic announcements. The most notable cyclical variation takes place within expansions: sensitivity is largest early in an expansion and essentially zero late in an expansion. By exploiting the comovement pattern between stocks and bonds around announcements, we show that the stock market sensitivity is large when the cash flow component of news is least offset by news about future risk-free rates. Observed fluctuations in stock sensitivities can be attributed to shifting perceptions of monetary policy responsiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhasing out the GSEsVadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, and Stijn Van NieuwerburghJournal of Monetary Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal]\nWe develop a new model of the mortgage market that emphasizes the role of the financial sector and the government. Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. Both borrowers and intermediaries can default. The government provides both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations and higher financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries’ balance sheets. Foreclosure crises beget fiscal uncertainty, further disrupting the optimal allocation of risk in the economy. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee “crowds in” the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector and less fiscal uncertainty, consumption smoothing improves and foreclosure rates fall. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases, so does wealth inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan the Covid Bailouts Save the Economy?Vadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, and Stijn Van NieuwerburghEconomic Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal] [Code]\nThe covid-19 crisis has led to a sharp deterioration in firm and bank balance sheets. The government has responded with a massive intervention in corporate credit markets. We study equilibrium dynamics of macroeconomic quantities and prices, and how they are affected by this policy response. The interventions prevent a much deeper crisis by reducing corporate bankruptcies by about half and short-circuiting the doom loop between corporate and financial sector fragility. The additional fiscal cost is zero since programme spending replaces what would otherwise have been spent on financial sector bailouts. An alternative intervention that targets aid to firms at risk of bankruptcy prevents more bankruptcies at much lower fiscal cost, but only enjoys marginally higher welfare. Finally, we study longer-run consequences for firm leverage and intermediary health when pandemics become the new normal.\nPresentations:\n\nEconomic Policy Panel Meeting, Virtual, Apr 2021 (by coauthor)\nAmerican Finance Association, Virtual, Jan 2021 (by coauthor)\nBank of Portugal, Virtual, Nov 2020\nIMF Annual Research Conference, Virtual, Nov 2020\nMelbourne, Virtual, Aug 2020\nMidwest Finance Association, Virtual, Jan 1900 (by coauthor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaggered Health Policy Adoption: Spillover Effects and Their ImplicationsVadim Elenev, Luis Quintero, Alessandro Rebucci, and Emilia SimeonovaManagement Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN] [Journal]\nThis paper investigates the direct and spillover effects on mobility caused by the staggered adoption of Stay-at-Home orders (SHOs) implemented by U.S. counties to contain the spread of COVID-19. We find that mobility in neighboring counties declines by a third to a half as much as in the counties that first implement the SHOs. Further, these spillovers are concentrated in counties that share media markets with treated counties. Using directional mobility data, we find that declines in internal mobility in the neighbor counties account for a much larger proportion of the overall decline in mobility than decreases in traffic originating in the treated county and headed to the neighbor. Together, these results provide strong evidence that SHOs operate through information sharing and voluntary social distancing. Based on our estimates and a simple model of staggered SHO adoption, we construct counterfactual scenarios that separate the impact of policy coordination from that of adoption timing. We demonstrate that staggered implementation of SHO policies can yield mobility reductions that are larger than coordinated but delayed SHO policy adoption."

We develop a model incorporating insured and uninsured deposits, interest rate-sensitive securities, and credit-risky loans to understand how banks respond to interest rate risk and the potential for deposit runs. The model delivers the concentration of uninsured deposits in larger banks and examines how banks’ portfolio- and funding choices impact financial stability. We study the effects of recent Federal Reserve rate hikes on banks and analyze micro-prudential policy tools to enhance the banking sector’s resilience. Higher liquidity requirements that target uninsured deposits are effective at curbing run risk of large banks, but cause misallocation in the lending market. Size-dependent capital requirements are equally effective at mitigating run risk, with minimal unintended consequences.\nPresentations:\n\nWestern Finance Association, Snowbird, UT, Jun 2025\nSFS Cavalcade, Hoboken, NJ, May 2025\nNBER Corporate Finance, Chicago, IL, Apr 2025 (by coauthor)\nNBER Financial Market Frictions and Systemic Risks, Boston, MA, Mar 2025\nMidwest Finance Association, Chicago, IL, Mar 2025\nHEC-McGill Winter Finance Workshop, Charlevoix, Quebec, Mar 2025 (by coauthor)\nUBC Winter Finance Conference, Whistler, BC, Feb 2025 (by coauthor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Comovement of Voter Preferences: Insights from U.S. Presidential Election Prediction Markets Beyond PollsMikhail Chernov, Vadim Elenev, Dongho Song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[NBER] [SSRN (Realtime Forecast)]\nWe propose a novel time-series econometric framework to forecast U.S. Presidential election outcomes in real time by combining polling data, economic fundamentals, and political prediction market prices. Our model estimates the joint dynamics of voter preferences across states. Applying our approach to the 2024 Presidential Election, we find a two-factor structure driving the vast majority of the variation in voter preferences. We identify electorally similar state clusters without relying on historical data or demographic models of voter behavior. Our simulations quantify the correlations between state-level election outcomes. Failing to take the correlations into account can bias the forecasted win probability for a given candidate by several percentage points. We find Pennsylvania to be the most pivotal state in the 2024 election, followed by Nevada. Our results provide insights for election observers, candidates, and traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Structure, Financial Stability, and Risk SharingVadim Elenev, Lu Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nMortgage structure matters not only for monetary policy transmission, but also for financial stability. In an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) regime, interest rate rises cause higher default rates due to increases in mortgage payments. In a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) regime, households are protected, but banks are potentially more exposed to rate rises. To evaluate these competing mechanisms under different mortgage regimes, we build a quantitative model with flexible mortgage contract structures, borrowers, and an intermediary sector. Our approach captures borrowers’ endogenous default decisions and intermediaries’ equilibrium pricing effects on mortgage rates and risk premia, reflecting the interaction between interest rate and credit risks, and intermediary net worth. We find that financial stability risks are “U-shaped” in mortgage structure: while ARM payments are more sensitive to interest rates, defaults happen in states when intermediary net worth is high, resulting in lower risk premia in constrained states of the world compared to the benchmark FRM economy. As a result, an intermediate mortgage fixation length minimizes the volatility of intermediary net worth and improves the sharing of aggregate risks. Our findings have implications for mortgage design, macroprudential, and monetary policy.\nPresentations:\n\nWestern Finance Association, Snowbird, UT, Jun 2025\nECB Conference on Financial Stability and Macroprudential Policy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Jun 2025 (by coauthor)\nSFS Cavalcade, Hoboken, NJ, May 2025\nColumbia Workshop in New Empirical Finance, New York, NY, May 2025\nChicago Fed, Chicago, IL, Apr 2025\nWharton, Philadelphia, PA, Mar 2025\nCUNY Baruch, New York, NY, Dec 2024\nAmerican Real Estate and Urban Economics Association National Conference, Washington, DC, May 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset Pricing with Optimal Under-DiversificationVadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nWe study sources and implications of undiversified portfolios in a production-based asset pricing model with financial frictions. Households take concentrated positions in a single firm exposed to idiosyncratic shocks because managerial effort requires equity stakes, and because investors gain private benefits from concentrated holdings. Matching data on returns and portfolios, we find that the marginal investor optimally holds 45% of their portfolio in a single firm, incentivizing managerial effort that accounts for 4% of aggregate output. Investors derive control benefits equivalent to 3% points of excess return, rationalizing low observed returns on undiversified holdings in the data. A counterfactual world of full diversification would feature higher risk free rates, lower risk premiums on fully diversified and concentrated assets, less capital accumulation, yet higher consumption and welfare. Exposure to undiversified firm risk can explain approximately 40% of the level and 20% of the volatility of the equity premium. A targeted subsidy that decreases diversification improves welfare by increasing managerial effort and reducing financial frictions.\nPresentations:\n\nMidwest Finance Association, Chicago, IL, Mar 2024\nUtah Winter Finance Conference, Snowbird, UT, Feb 2024 (by coauthor)\nAmerican Finance Association, San Antonio, TX, Jan 2024\nEuropean Finance Association, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Aug 2023\nWestern Finance Association, San Francisco, CA, Jun 2023\nMinnesota Macro and Asset Pricing, Minneapolis, MN, May 2023 (by coauthor)\nAdam Smith Workshop, Oxford, U.K., Apr 2023 (by coauthor)\nHong Kong University, Virtual, Apr 2023\nGerman Economists Abroad, Mannheim, Germany, Dec 2023 (by coauthor)\nITAM, Mexico City, Mexico, Oct 2023\nUVa Darden, Charlottesville, VA, Sep 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Monetary Policy Create Fiscal Capacity?Vadim Elenev, Tim Landvoigt, Patrick Shultz, and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nGovernments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the GFC and Covid crises, increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid? What role do conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, and substantial risk premia. During a large economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. Quantitative easing (QE) contributes to lowering the debt/GDP ratio and reducing the risk of future tax increases. QE is state- and duration-dependent: while a temporary QE policy deployed in a crisis stimulates aggregate demand, permanent QE crowds out investment and lowers long-run output.\nPresentations:\n\nAmerican Economic Association, New Orleans, LA, Jan 2023\nNebraska, Lincoln, NE, Sep 2022\nEuropean Finance Association, Barcelona, Spain, Aug 2022 (by coauthor)\nMinnesota Macro Workshop, Minneapolis, MN, Jul 2022 (by coauthor)\nSociety of Economic Dynamics, Madison, WI, Jun 2022 (by coauthor)\nWestern Finance Association, Portland, OR, Jun 2022 (by coauthor)\nFinancial Intermediary Research Society, Budapest, Hungary, Jun 2022\nUSC Marshall, Los Angeles, CA, Apr 2022\nTepper LAEF Advances in Macro Finance, Santa Barbara, CA, Apr 2022\nAdam Smith Workshop, Fontainebleau, France, Apr 2022 (by coauthor)\nUNC Jackson Hole Winter Finance, Teton Village, WY, Jan 2022\nCarnegie Mellon Tepper, Virtual, Oct 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Credit, Aggregate Demand, and Unconventional Monetary PolicyVadim Elenev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SSRN]\nI develop a quantitative model of the mortgage market operating in an economy with financial frictions and nominal rigidities. I use this model to study the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by a central bank as a tool of monetary policy. When negative shocks hit, homeowner and financial sector balance sheets are impaired, borrowing constraints bind, asset prices and aggregate demand drop, hampering the transmission of conventional monetary policy. LSAPs boost aggregate demand in a crisis by directing additional lending to homeowners, raising house prices, and establishing expectations of future financial stability. However, legacy household debt depresses output and consumption in recovery. In the long run, a commitment to ongoing use of LSAPs in crises reduces credit and business cycle volatility and redistributes resources from borrowers and intermediaries to savers.\nPresentations:\n\nJHU Applied Math, Baltimore, MD, Mar 2019\nJHU Econ, Baltimore, MD, Apr 2018\nCUNY Baruch, New York, NY, Nov 2017\nPenn State Smeal, State College, PA, Oct 2017\nSyracuse Whitman, Syracuse, NY, Feb 2017\nWharton, Philadelphia, PA, Feb 2017\nUCSD Rady, La Jolla, CA, Feb 2017\nWashington University Olin, Clayton, MO, Feb 2017\nImperial College, London, U.K., Feb 2017\nLondon Business School, London, U.K., Feb 2017\nJohns Hopkins Carey, Baltimore, MD, Jan 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative TighteningVadim Elenev, Miguel Faria e Castro, and Daniel Greenwald\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentations:\n\nDC-Area Juniors, Washington, DC, May 2019\nAmerican Real Estate and Urban Economics Association, Washington DC, May 2019\nUMBC, Catonsville, MD, Apr 2019\nUNC Junior Finance Roundtable, Chapel Hill, NC, Mar 2019\nAmerican Economic Association, San Diego, CA, Jan 2019 (by coauthor)"
